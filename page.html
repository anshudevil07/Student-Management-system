  <h4>LPU CSE Students Developed A System, Food Pi, To Monitor Fridge Hygiene</h4><br>
  <p>The recent times taught us the unforgettable lesson of life and that’s health. Health is richness, health is beyond the price and a healthy body is a divine temple of power and positivity. What we eat pivotally plays a role in keeping our body healthful and fit. Occasional fast-food diets are absolutely fine. Whereas, occasional rotten dinners, breakfasts or lunches are brutally inexcusable.

      How to keep clean of what we eat? The answer is happily lying in your refrigerators right now. Yes, it’s the growing microbes on rotten vegetables and fruits inside the fridge.

      Technology – a labour of love

      In the first place, most people least care about their refrigerators and tend to blame their restless hectic lives. And is there any suitable solution? Well, yes.

      Our busy lives are unknowingly becoming slaves of our phones. And that’s how the scintillating Computer Science and Engineering students of Lovely Professional University thought to help us out. They designed and built a smart device called Food Pi. This innovation alarms us about the rotting items in the fridge through timely notifications. Food Pi functions through a mobile app that is now available for both Android and IOS gadgets.</p>
